# Hangman
This React Hangman solver implements the algorithm described by YouTuber Jan Misali in their video [Hangman is a Weird Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le5uGqHKll8). Animations are implemented with react-spring. The website is self-explanatory: choose a word length, then let the algorithm try to guess your word.

A version of this project is hosted at https://github.com/benjamin-peng/hangman.
